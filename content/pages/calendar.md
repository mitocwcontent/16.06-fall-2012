This calendar outlines the sessions for the course including the relative timing of the lectures (L), recitations (R), problem sets, and exams. Recitations typically met in between the first and second lecture of every week. The two quizzes were held on the same day as the recitations and replaced the second lecture for the week. Problem sets were due weekly on the third session of the week with some fluctuation due to holidays
